Windy plugin that gives shows sun and moon position on the map and gives details about sunset and sunrise times as well as other sun and moon details. To use the published version, go to [www.windy.com](https://www.windy.com), open the menu, click on "Install Windy plugin", enter "windy-plugin-sun-position" and click "Load plugin".

**The access to the plugin has changed in Version 0.2.0 to allow for mobile usage!**
To open the display, right-click on the map (or tap and hold on mobile), then select "Sun Position". Then open a weather picker to see the sun dial and the details on the left

### Dial
The dial displays the current sun and moon azimuth on the map using a black line from the picker position. Additionally, dashed lines show the azimuth of sunrise and sunset and dotted lines show the azimuth of moonrise and moonset. Clicking on the sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset lines will set the current time to the respective time.

### Detail pane
The detail pane on the left shows the time of astronomical, nautical, and civil dusk and dawn; start and end of blue and golden hour and solar noon. Moonrise and moonset times are also added to the timeline. Below, a diagram of the sun and moon altitudes over time is displayed. Below that, details about the current sun and moon position are shown.

On the top of the detail pane it is possible to enable and disable individual displays. The telescope toggles visibility of astronomical sun details (astronomical and nautical dawn and dusk). The camera toggles visibility of blue and golden hour times. The moon toggles visibility of moon details.
